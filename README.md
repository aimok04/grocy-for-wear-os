Grocy for Wear OS is an unofficial client for the grocy groceries & household management server for Google's Wear OS smartwatch operating system.

Currently the app only works as a viewer for shopping lists, but more features may be supported in the future (if I'll have time to do that Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯)
